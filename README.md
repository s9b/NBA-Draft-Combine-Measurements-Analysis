# NBA Draft Analysis 🏀💻

Introduction

🎉 Welcome to my NBA draft analysis project! 🎉

In this project, I created a dataset of NBA players and used machine learning techniques to analyze and predict their success based on their physical attributes and skills. The goal of this project is to provide a robust predictive model that can be used by NBA teams to inform their draft decisions.

Dataset

📊 I created the dataset from scratch using Google Colab! 📊

The dataset includes player information such as:

Height
Weight
Wingspan
Vertical leap
Lane agility time
And more! 🤯
Python File

📝 The Python file used to create the dataset is included in this repository: nba combine data.ipynb 📝

Analysis

📊 I used a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to develop a robust predictive model. 📊

The analysis includes:

Handling missing values
Data normalization
Feature selection
Model selection (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
Hyperparameter tuning
Feature importance analysis
Prediction of player success
Results

🏆 The results of the analysis are presented in the NBA Draft Analysis.ipynb file. 🏆

Requirements

Google Colab
Python 3.8+
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
matplotlib
